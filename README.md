# Welcome to Stock-Tracker-App

## Overview

**Prominent Stock Tracker** is a desktop application that tracks and organizes stock trades and financial disclosures made by prominent individuals such as CEOs, executives, and politicians. It features an interactive user interface built with Tkinter and allows users to export collected data into `.csv` or `.json` formats for external analysis.
